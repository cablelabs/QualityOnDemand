# v0.1.0 - Initial contribution

**Initial contribution of two API definitions for Quality on Demand (stable bandwidth and stable latency)**, including initial documentation and implementation code.

## Please note 
- this "release" is only tagged to document the history of the API, it is not intended to be used by implementors or API customers
- it was implemented by Deutsche Telekom within lab environment and tested against two NEF implementations
- going forward the implementation [code](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/tree/50e81e0c4a6a7431c0a7f50c26415caf935be6df/code/API_code) will not be part of releases of QoD API. Instead it will be provided within separate repositories (QualityOnDemand_PIx).
